## Projects

### AI Chatbot

Currently working on building chatbot using Messenger framework and Wit.AI for text and
speech-based inputs. Languages used: Python.

### Cognitive Melodies

The project aimed at
predicting and recommending songs based on the mood of the listener. The mood is predicted by using acoustic
data (low-level features like MFCC) of the songs. Languages & Technology used: Python, Sci-kit, Weka, JSON, AcousticcBrainz.

### Brain Computer Interface

A Neural Network based project that aims to research the state
of human brain under the influence of music. Languages & Technology used: Python, OpenBCI

### SRM Search Engine

I worked as Lead Infrastructure at SRM SE. Aim of SRM-SE was to create an India centric search engine with clustered results, advanced knowledge database and a different UI. I led a team of around 10 DevOps engineers and handled the distributed crawling server, network infrastructre and security of our datacenter.

### SRM SDC-Test Beds

Built a private cloud using OpenStack and SoCware Defined Networking.
Migrated the CSE Department server to this private cloud. Languages & Technology used: OpenStack,
SDN, Python, AWS

## Awards/Additional Interests

__AIESEC Empower (2012)__: Business idea selected among top 5. The idea was about creating a platform to
bring together holistic and philanthropic people.

__Regional Mathematics Olympiad (2008)__: Secured 7th rank in RMO, Gujarat region.

__National Throw ball Tournament__: Represented Gujarat state(India) in the National Throwball tournament.

Certified __PADI Open-Water__ Scuba Diver.

Music, especially country music and alternative rock, are my favorite. Eventually, I explore good movies to
discover good soundtracks, hence, a movie buff too.

Might even give up precious sleeps for Roadtrips, exciting Books, Live Music Concerts and Beers.

<!-- ## Placements
